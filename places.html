    <div>
        <h2>Strawberry Falls</h2>
        <img src="images/20220816_201127.jpg" alt="Strawberry Falls shoreline">

        
            <p>While perhaps not as exciting as the other entries on this list, Strawberry Falls perfectly encapsulates
                the
                Pacific Northwest's unique ecology as the short trek through the inumberable evergreens spills way into
                the
                sprawling sandy beach, its horizon dotted by towering seastacks that are jaw dropping no matter the time
                of
                day or weather.</p>

            <p>Ideal for day hikes or overnight stays, Strawberry falls has the best campsites on this list as many are
                situated right on the beach ensuring an unforgettable sunrise. Also, because it's not located in the
                Puget
                Sound and instead facing the Pacific Ocean it's great for surfing. </p>

        <h2>Fort Worden</h2>
        <img src="images/mT9oDqo882FdUgpzpj6RSQDb6uSgg5rRaSrC7ygMsQs.webp" alt="Coastal Bunker">

        
            <p>Constructed between the late nineteenth and early twentieth century in response to mounting concerns over
                America's lackluster coastal defenses, these so called Endicott Period forts were once state of the art
                as
                they employed breachloading cannons and reinforced concrete defenses. The Second World War would show
                that
                these concerns weren't entirely unfounded, making it all the more fortunant that these coastal batteries
                were never used. Now Fort Worden along with its many siblings including Fort Casey, and Flagler stand in
                silent vigil overlooking the Salish Sea.</p>

            <p>While by no means difficult, this turn of the century military installation will take several hours to
                explore and many of the bunkers themselves are unlit. Also, overnight camping within the bunkers
                themselves
                is not permitted. I'd highly recommend Fort Worden for first timers. </p>

        <h2>Tubal Cain Mine</h2>
        <img src="images/CDDCA896-86FB-4A61-A313-AB8816F526C0.jpeg" alt="Mangled Airframe">

        
            <p>As the name suggests this trail features an abandoned copper mine. Closed sometime in the early twenties
                following nonexistant profits the shaft itself is completely flooded and for those who value self
                preservation the only evidence of its existence being the mine entrace itself and the abandoend
                equipment
                that lay scattered throughout the campgrounds in the form of perforated boilers and rusted minecarts.
                I've
                heard some people venture past the entrance, however swimming in freezing, stagnant water with no light
                miles away from emergency responders seems ill-advised. </p>

            <p>But if that wasn't intriguing enough climb a few miles more any you'll find the mangled remains of a B-17
                bomber. Retrofitted for non-combat use after WW2 the tail of the aircraft clipped the top of the
                Cascades
                sending the plane hurdling into the value below. From the wreckage its a wonder anyone survived as its
                only
                recognizable by its landing gear and a few propellerless engines. </p>

            <p>Definitely the hardest hike of the three. The initial trek to the mine takes several hours and features a
                precarious washout next to a cliff. After that there's getting to the bomber and when I said climb I
                meant
                it. The incline feels a few degrees short of rock climbing and that isn't helped by the several streams
                crosscutting the trail up lined with slippery rocks. A little strenuous for a day hike, the plane itself
                crash landed in a marsh so I wouldn't recommend bringing a new pair of shoes if you want to get to each
                major piece of debris. Also mosquitos, lots
                of mosquitos. </p>
